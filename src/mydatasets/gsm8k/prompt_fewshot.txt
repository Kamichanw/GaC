Question: Georgie is a varsity player on a football team. He can run 40 yards within 5 seconds. If he can improve his speed by forty percent, how many yards will he be able to run within 10 seconds?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The additional yard he will be able to run to after improving his speed is 40 x 40/100 = 16 yards.
So the total yard he will be able to run to after improving his speed is 40 + 16 = 56 yards in 5 seconds.
Therefore the total yards he will be able to run to within 10 seconds is 56 x 2 = 112.

Question: A shoe company sells $4000 worth of shoes every month. If they want to make $60000 in an entire year how many more dollars per month should they make selling shoes?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The amount of money they currently make in a year is 12 * 4000 = $48000.
The additional amount they need to make is $60000 - $48000= $12000 per year.
So, they should make $12000 / 12 = $1000 more every month.

Question: Olga has an aquarium with fish in 5 different colors. There are 12 yellow ones, half as many blue ones, and twice as many green ones as yellow ones. How many fish does Olga have in her aquarium?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Olga has half as many blue fish as yellow ones, which means 12 * 0.5 = 6 blue fish.
Green fish are twice as many as yellow ones, so in total there are 12 * 2 = 24 green fish.
So all the fish sum up to 12 + 6 + 24 = 42.
